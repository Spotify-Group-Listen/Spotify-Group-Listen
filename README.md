# Spotify-Group-Listen
When you are listening to music with a bunch of friends, you often will get asked to play some songs, after a while it gets quite annoying to pass your phone or go and search up the song yourself, especially if you're doing something. Worse yet, you accidentally press play instead of "add to queue" and skip all of the songs that you have just added.

This is my solution.

You can create a room, send the code to everyone and anyone will be able to add songs to your queue without you lifting a finger
